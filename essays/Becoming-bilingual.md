## First Words
  Although I have worked with javascript in High School, I did not have a strong understanding with it. The experience 
  I gained from my previous courses made transitioning back to javascript a lot smoother. From the intro level work so 
  far, javascript is a lot more lax with their code compared to Java such as the lack of need with semicolons, although 
  still recommended. I believe it is still too early for me to fully discuss the complete Venn diagram between Java and 
  Javascript, but I believe both have some decent similarities in how I think of a problem. Along with my amateur experience 
  with Javascript, the most I know about Javascript is its use with web applications in the front end, and nearly nothing 
  about other parts it has to do with software engineering. If I were to build web applications I believe that Javascript 
  is a great language to use. When it comes to learning a new language, especially as a programming infant, there are 
  plenty of cool things to learn.

## Mind Workout

  WOD's are a test of one's knowledge, not far from a math or writing an exam. Answering a question within a time frame 
  based on the problems we have done before on our homework or classwork is much like any other quiz. But because it is 
  computer science, it stresses how good of a problem solver we can be. If I'm prepared I believe I can work very well 
  under stress, but if I fall behind in this course there is no doubt that these WOD's will be a nightmare. I do enjoy 
  stress, but stress is not always a good way of seeing a performance as there are many people who do worse with stress. 
  On the contrary, the continuous act of stress will prepare us for our work interviews in the future. This kind of stress 
  also forces students to prepare through practice. I am perfectly fine with WOD's, but I believe the grading system should 
  include partial points, especially if the code has only produced a small error or two. 
  
  
  In my experience with WOD's, specifically the group class WOD, I had a slow start and made it through, through the 
  help of my partner. Following that poor performance I decided to practice the WOD practices, we were given through Euler. 
  When it came to the practice WOD on Wednesday, I was able to finish the WOD in less than five minutes. I believe 
  through a lot of trial and error, I can become proficient in solving problems. Work me but don't kill me.
