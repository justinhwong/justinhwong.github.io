## First Words
  Although I have worked with javascript in High School, I did not have a strong understanding with it. The experience I gained from my previous courses made transitioning back to javascript a lot smoother. From the intro level work so far, javascript is a lot more lax with their code compared to Java such as the lack of need with semicolons, although still recommended. I believe it is still too early for me to fully discuss the complete venn diagram between Java and Javascript but I believe both have some decent similarities in how I think of a problem. Along with my amateur experience with Javascript, the most I know with Javascript is its use with web applications in the front end, and nearly nothing about other parts it has to do with software engineering. If I were to build web applications I believe that Javascript is a great language to use.

## Mind Workout
  WOD's are a test of one's knowledge, not far from a math or writing exam. Answering a question within a time frame based on problems we have done before on our homework or classwork is much like any othe quiz. But because it is computer science, it stresses how good of a problem solver we can be. If I'm prepared I believe I can work very well under stress, but if I fall behind in this course I believe that these WOD's will be a nightmare. I do enjoy stress but stress is not always a good way of seeing performance as there are many people who do worse with stress. On the contrary, the continous act of stress will prepare us for our work interviews in the future. This kind of stress also forces students to prepare through practice. I am perfectly fine with WOD's, but I believe the grading system should include partial points, especially if the code produced has only a small error or two. 
  
  In my experience with WOD's, specifically the group class WOD, I had a slow start and made it through, through the help of my partner. Following that poor performance I decided to practice the WOD practices we were given through Euler. When it came to the practice WOD on Wednesday, I was able to finish the WOD in less than five minutes. I believe through a lot of trial and error, I can become profficient in solving problems.
