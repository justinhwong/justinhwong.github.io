## Enforcing Ethics Education
  Ethics is a ruleset, decisions, and actions of a person. As a software engineer they are expected, as professionals, to work in the benefit of others.
  Professionals earn and gain the respect of others through their hard work, but also by their actions. Ethics is much more complex
  then deciding what is right and what is wrong. A sense of self morals is also incorporated into ethics. Every person has their own
  "ethics ruleset" that they abide by, but many aren't aware of how their rules were created. I believe that ethics is a responsibility
  of an individual to provide what they believe is right for others. Working in the interest of others does not always lead you to the correct 
  path, and that is the sole reason why self morals are important to incorporate into ethics. Understanding what forms your choices is 
  what helps progress your views on your ideals and also evolves your code of ethics.
  
## Experiencing ESLint
  Starting out with IntelliJ in general was an interesting transition from JSFiddle. Having to include multiple things within our WODs seems a lot more strenuous at first, but smooths out after a couple practices. Installing ESLint and checking coding standards first took minimum five minutes, but I can now do it between 2 and 3. Although I believe coding standards are a fundamental part of learning how to code, I believe it should not be stressed during a timed environment such as our WODs. It would be a terrible feeling to complete the WOD and then be unable to get the green check although it is unlikely. Learning wise, I believe ESLint is a good checker, much like CheckStyle which we had to use in ICS 211. As the semester continues, ESLint errors will be a lot easier to work around, and hopefully it will just become second nature.
