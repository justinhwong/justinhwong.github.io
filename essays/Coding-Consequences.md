## Building Basics
Coding is very much like learning a language, in learning and in application. Many of us express ourselves differently in languages, and likewise, we all code in our own personal style. On the contrary, when things become formal, there then becomes a set standard. In essays, we have to include transitions, indent, and use proper diction as a formality. Similarly in coding, we have coding standards where we have to format our code in a more universal, readable way. Writing essays provide a consistent read for all viewers. When coding, we want others to understand what we write, so why not follow a format that everyone can understand? 
  
  
Inside my AP English class, my teacher once told me that a student of his was able to create a template for his essays that would guarantee him a good score. Following a coding standard could set us up and provide a foundation for our future coding endeavors. If we can do the fundamentals, we can achieve higher heights. Learning coding standards is much like learning a template, or even taking notes. You are actively coding while learning coding standards, and much of the standards are already incorporated inside coding fundamentals. When you understand coding standards, chances are that you will understand the fundamentals of coding as well.
  

When you learn coding standards, you will understand other's code more. When working on a group project, or working for a future company, it would prove to be useful, when you can quickly understand another's code. Noone likes to read a disorganized book, so you should not write like a disorganized author. 

## Experiencing ESLint
  Starting out with IntelliJ in general was an interesting transition from JSFiddle. Having to include multiple things within our WODs seems a lot more strenuous at first, but smooths out after a couple practices. Installing ESLint and checking coding standards first took minimum five minutes, but I can now do it between 2 and 3. Although I believe coding standards are a fundamental part of learning how to code, I believe it should not be stressed during a timed environment such as our WODs. It would be a terrible feeling to complete the WOD and then be unable to get the green check although it is unlikely. Learning wise, I believe ESLint is a good checker, much like CheckStyle which we had to use in ICS 211. As the semester continues, ESLint errors will be a lot easier to work around, and hopefully it will just become second nature.
