## Expanding Versatility
  When it comes to coding in general, it is important to expand your knowledge. The more you learn, the more adept and complete you become. 


## Experiencing ESLint
  Starting out with IntelliJ in general was an interesting transition from JSFiddle. Having to include multiple things within our WODs seems a lot more strenuous at first, but smooths out after a couple practices. Installing ESLint and checking coding standards first took minimum five minutes, but I can now do it between 2 and 3. Although I believe coding standards are a fundamental part of learning how to code, I believe it should not be stressed during a timed environment such as our WODs. It would be a terrible feeling to complete the WOD and then be unable to get the green check although it is unlikely. Learning wise, I believe ESLint is a good checker, much like CheckStyle which we had to use in ICS 211. As the semester continues, ESLint errors will be a lot easier to work around, and hopefully it will just become second nature.
