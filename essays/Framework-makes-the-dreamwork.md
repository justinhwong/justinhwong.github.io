## Expanding Versatility

  When it comes to coding in general, it is important to expand your knowledge. The more you learn, the more adept and complete you become. Coding is like a toolbox, and the more variety of tools you have, the more prepared you become to solving a problem. UI frameworks are packed with any UI components that you need in your projects. Investing your time to learn a framework will ultimately decrease the amount of time you would need to create a website in comparison to using bare HTML and CSS. Efficiency and problem solving are a large part in becoming a good programmer

  Much like coding standards, the use of frameworks is very common. The more you know about software engineering, the less issues you will run into when you work with others in the workforce. There is a reason why large companies using frameworks. It saves time, and because many options are already set up for you, you will run into a lot less issues then if you started from scratch. Especially for beginning programmers, UI frameworks can be seen as a template for a standard website. The understanding of framework basics will undoubtedly help your websites get more clicks in the long run.

## Shifting to Semantic

  When we first got into HTML and CSS everything flowed smoothly as I already had a couple months of experience in high school. Similarily to how we decided on our own website to copy, we were required to make our own website inside my STEM class. The difference between the websites I created then and now was the resources I could use. Creating my website back in high school consisted of raw HTML and CSS, and even through hours of work, my website was a joke to any practice WOD we had completed thus far. Even though Semantic UI was an extra learning curve for HTML and CSS, I don't believe it there was a large jump in difficulty. I believe that HTML and CSS have been the easiest to read code, as the semantics and syntax define clearly. It is exactly the same for Semantic, at least so far. "centered" centers whatever item you have, "two column" makes the container two columns, etc. I can now, in the same amount of time, create a much better website using Semantic UI.
