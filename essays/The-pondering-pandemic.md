## My Personal Pandemic
<p align="center"><img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/stressing.jpg"></p>
   I can't say that I'm not enjoying myself more often due to being at home all the time, but I am. I no longer have to 
   wake up early to go to class as my teacher records her 
    zoom instructions. Because I only have to attend lectures from time to time, I have a lot more free time to do
    things I want, like getting ahead in assignments or hobbies that I couldn't do due to school and work. Likewise, I
    no longer have to work as much as I used to which adds up even more time I can spend on doing other things. Even 
    though school is still in session I am able to relax, a silver lining during a pandemic.

 I'm not the type of person to like going out a lot, but that's because it's enough for me to see my friends at 
 school. I properly workout anymore, my parents are always yelling at me whenever I'm not doing something 
 productive, and none of my friends enjoy playing the games I like. Boredom, a first world problem now seems to
 be global as everyone should be staying home. 

## The College Cost
   The absence of school life makes it feel like an extended spring break. With the ability to sleep in and do 
    classwork in the comfort of my own home, it is a stress reliever for a lot of students. On the contrary there is a 
    lot of things that have been hindered dude to the virus. Club, fairs, and meetings have all been dropped or at least
    substantially reduced. College is a time of making connections, meeting new people and doing new things. Due to the
    virus I can't helped but feel robbed of what College is about. Their is also something about learning inside an
    environment where you are conditioned to learn. Many of us who are at home are used to being relaxed at home, and 
    don't have the self learning drive to work as hard as they did before the Corona pandemic. I find myself having to 
    push myself harder when it comes to completing work than before.

 The age of technology thrives during this pandemic. ICS courses have been the ones who have best adapted when we
 moved to online courses. Everything has already been recorded on YouTube, assignments are pre-made and can still be
 applied on schedule. In fact, most of the topics we learned in 314 have been from assignments and practices that 
 we do at home. Computer science is one of the most self directed career after all. Solutions for colleges in 
 future pandemics is just an issue of preparedness. As a country we were not prepared, and it is a good lesson to
 prepare for workloads to move online. We are in the technology age and as we advance there will hopefully be
 better applications and set instructions for when an emergency happens again. So much free time lets us ponder.
 Perhaps some of us ICS students will lead that advancement.
