## Little Thought Losers
 When asking for help from either a forum or a professor, it is important to intelligently. In comparison to high school where a teacher has enough time to help kids one on one, professors and online helpers have a lot more people to attend to. It is incredibly wasteful to ask a question that could have been answered elsewhere or solved through a few minutes of troubleshooting. The opportunity cost of answering your question is the time lost that could have been used to solve other's. We all had that experience as a student in primary school where a random kid in the class would ask a stupid question. But the teacher would always proclaim that there actually weren't any stupid questions. There are stupid questions, or following Raymond's guide, there are "loser" questions. Much like how a solution has to be worked through multiple steps, so must a question. 
  The stackOverflow question I found did little of what Raymond had recommended. This is a prime example of a loser question. From the beginning this question seems easily accessible through a google search, and it was. Moreover, the question gave little thought into what he had tried to solve the solution, nor gave much information to portray his desire to learn the subject matter. It was brought up much like a homework question, as a dedicated learner would have most likely searched up a similiar question instead. Contrary to what Raymond said in his post, he actually was able to get multiple replies. Besides the replies, the downvotes and answers were very similiar to what Raymond had said. There was a comment claiming the simplicity, while the top comment was just an answer without an explanation.

## Establishing Efficency
  As a software engineer efficiency is very important. So when we have an online forum that helps out the amateurs, we ought to be thankful for their time. Being understandable, and uploading quality questions are a great way to make a helper help you. Much like Raymond says, a great question is considered a great compliment by software engineers. It makes them feel more valued, instead of a robot that spits out homework answers whenever you need it. Helping others learn is a passion, and is what make teachers and college professors so great. From the smart stackOverflow question I was able to find, the question was informative and clear. It was a simple question about specific syntax but following Raymond's guide, this person had already done a google search of the question and was unable to find the answer. Judging how the question was also asked, it was most likely not a homework question and was instead, most likely a student wanting to understand the details. He was able to to get a quick answer and solution. This is what all basic questions should be.
