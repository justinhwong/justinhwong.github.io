## Everybody's Guide
  As a programmer you will face many obstacles that you will have to fix. Problem solving is a crucial skill needed
  as a programmer, as it's not as formulaic as a subject such as Algebra. Difficulties arise when errors within your project
  occurs. Design patterns give us the light in the a dark tunnel. Instead of going through every step and thinking for hours
  and hours, design patterns give you a route. Design patterns are not a key to unlock a door but more of clues to help find a 
  villian. As in, it describes different situations and provides design patterns that can help reduce error, increase 
  efficiency, and is multi applicable. The application of patterns can be attributed to anything, especially as something
  competitive. I like to spend my free time playing a competitive shooter game, and there are many strategies to counteract
  your enemies. If the enemies love rushing in, a good general method would to be throwing utility such as smokes, molotovs,
  or flashbangs to slow them down. Understanding Design patterns are a good way for amateurs learn problem solving as
  well as understanding the act they are doing better.
  
## Find your own pattern
New programmers have a lot of issues keeping their code clean and concise. They have much more issues when it comes to 
tackling an error or problem that they can't seem to fix. We model our flea market website to work much what we expect
from general websites with albeit not nearly on par. The basic fundamentals however are still there, which in this situation 
is through the manipulation of our listed in items, an observer where we can change the state of the items that we posted.
Furthermore, building a website is a step by step process. It has its own template that we abide by, creating the landing page 
first so users can access and view our website, to then login in which they can view our other pages. As we continue to build
more functionality and pages we will eventually be at a point where we have a decent page running!

## A way of life

Humans largely see many things as patterns. This is the strength of humans, to be able to problem solve through seeing patterns
allow us to better understand what is in front of us. This is why many IQ tests include pattern finding in their tests. 
We have been problem solving constantly since birth, and developing patterns in effect developed formulas which furthered
our problem solving capabilities. Patterns are extremely powerful, and templates such as formulas help strengthen and further
our understanding. If we use them through everyday means, we should certainly be using it when learning programming.
