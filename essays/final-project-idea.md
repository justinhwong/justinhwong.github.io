## Overview
  The Problem: Students aren't doing much extra curricular activities such as joining clubs or self
  projects. Extra curricular activities are a a good way to build up your resume as well as meeting 
  new people. People aren't making the most out of their college career so we will bring college to 
  them.
  
  <p></p>
  
  Th Solution: Create a system that showcases each club, and their previous work as well as 
  giving students the ability to share their thoughts about the club.
  
## Mockup page ideas
Within this application students will be able to go through categories of clubs and view the club
they are interested in. Users will be able to submit a request for, or submit the club that exists
or wish to create. People who login can put in their thoughts for clubs that already exist, as well
as input for clubs that are a work in progress. In total there will be two roles, users who comment
and add to the discussion, and admins that approve of the messages and can maintain the messages.
Their should also be a role that indicates the club that you are in.

<p></p>

The overall reason for this application is for people to communicate the pros and cons of clubs, as
well as inviting and encouraging others to join their club. The clubs should post all the public 
things they can, and users can add the club to their thinking list in which they can later decide
whether they want to join a club or not.

</ul>
