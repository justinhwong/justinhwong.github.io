## Rainbow Retail
The goal of this project was to create a website where UH students can buy and sell items, similar functionality to 
Facebook Marketplace. There is a category page that splits items into sections. There is of course an add item page, as
well as a listing page that showcases all the items. Alongside that there is also a profile page for the user and an about
page that provides information on the website. The way to buy and sell items is through a chat function which is connected
to the items. As an admin you can delete items, and review items that people have reported.

The issues that I were tasked to do were moving from using default files to our own. I also contributed to item database,
the design of items, edit button, share button, the profile page, the posting item page and the admin page. Along with 
my teammate Patima, 
we were scheduling and managing the team's issues, processes, as well as meetings. Working as a team on a large scale 
project was a really great experience. There was a lot of communication errors, as well as a lot of messups using github.
Problem solving issues such as a bad merge were really stressful but was a great experience when everything goes wrong. 
Issue management, working on respective issues in which we can all work together cohesively was also a new experience as
we would have to pull the work from others before we can pull request our own. Along with managing issues, team management
I believe was the most important experience coming from this project. Understanding what your teammates can and cannot do,
helping teammates when they have issues, as well as taking over issues that people won't or can't complete. I learned
how to strive despite multiple deficits or hindrances as well as an appreciation for hard workers.
